I have a box online that is not allowing me to pull up the kodi web interface. Can you check on this one for me:
http://172.31.145.86:8080/

FIX :
1. Go to ~/.kodi/userdata/

Edit the guisettings.xml file in the userdata folder and look for the following settings under "<services>", and make sure they are set to "true". You'll have to look for them a little bit, because there among several other settings. Assuming you have not set a password or changed other default settings, this should work:
<esallinterfaces> - true
<webserver> - true
<zeroconf> - true
Save the file and restart Kodi.
