ISSUE :
When running the script with coreELEC v9.2.8 on Tanix boxes
The move to internal ain't working.

BOXES AFFECTED :
smb://172.31.145.103/
smb://172.31.145.106/

OBSERVATIONS :
The internal storage is /dev/sda1

SOLUTION :
For now, I manually ran the moving to internal from USB booted OS,
```printf 'yes\ny\nn\n'|installtointernal```

FIX :
In the ansible, ``when: internal_storage is regex("/dev/mmc.*") ``
Need to work on this regex check.
